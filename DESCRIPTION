Title: Transitioning from Excel? This package makes some things easier.
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Steph de Silva
Maintainer: Steph de Silva <steph@rex-analytics.com>
Description: This package automates a suite of descriptive statistics in the 
    same format as you would generate using Excel's descriptive statistics TookPak.
    There's nothing 'special' going on here under the hood - but with one function call
    you can get all the things you usually would in Excel. This makes it easier for you to
    transition from Excel - get what you need and know quickly, so you can spend more
    time getting up to speed on the basics.
    Once you have the basics down in R, you'll probably never use this pacakge again.
    If that's what happens - this is GREAT. And just what it's for.
